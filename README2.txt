H3K4me3 and Cxxc1 Chip of three subsets of ILC3s were both performed on 100,000 cells as previously described with modifications according to the protocol of Hyperactive In-Situ ChIP Library Prep Kit for Illumina (TD 901, Vazyme).
All raw sequence data were quality trimmed using fastp (version0.19.7) and aligned to the mm10 mouse genome using Bowtie2 (version 2.3.5.1) with options' –local–very-sensitive-local–no-unal–nomixed–no-discordant–phred33 -I 10 -X 700'. PCR duplicates were removed using Picard MarkDuplicates (version 2.25.0). Peaks were called using MACS2 (version 2.2.7.1) with options 'q 0.05'. DeepTools2 software (version 3.5.1) was used to create the peaks density plot and heatmap graph. Visualization of peak distribution along genomic regions of interested genes was performed with IGV. Genomic annotation was assigned using ChIPSeeker (version 1.28.3). Promoters were defined as follows: within 3000bp around the transcriptional start site (TSS). Differential expression analysis of two groups was performed using DESeq2 (version 1.30.1).
